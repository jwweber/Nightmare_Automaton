# Nightmare_Automaton

Please download and view the video demonstraion above.

The Nightmare Automaton is a finite automaton that generates errie sounding music based around the regular expression it was designed to
accept strings for. The program visualizes the string generation and plays musical notes according to the labels of the states visited. 
The automaton as a start state and two accept states marked by outlines. When an edge is used for a transition, its corresponding symbol is
then appended to the output string and a new note is played. This traversal occurs until the automaton halts.
